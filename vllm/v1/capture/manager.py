"""Multi-consumer capture manager.

``CaptureManager`` is the per-runner object that coordinates activation
capture across an ordered tuple of ``CaptureSink`` instances.  Each sink
corresponds to one registered capture consumer (e.g., filesystem writer,
reward trainer, dashboard).

Key design properties:

- **Union gather:** When multiple consumers want rows from the same
  ``(layer, hook)`` pair, the gather happens once.  Each entry's
  ``consumer_mask`` bitset records which consumers want it so the
  dispatch path can fan-out without redundant GPU reads.

- **Consumer isolation:** A failing ``submit_chunk`` or
  ``submit_finalize`` on one sink never prevents delivery to the others.
  Errors are captured per ``(consumer, request)`` and surfaced through
  ``CaptureResult``.

- **Position expansion:** The manager resolves the five selector
  modes (``last_prompt``, ``all_prompt``, ``all_generated``, ``all``,
  explicit ``list[int]``) and intersects the result with the step's
  ``[num_computed, num_computed + num_scheduled)`` window.

See ``docs/design/capture_consumers.md`` for the full spec.
